### About
A To Do List app implemented using Swift/Storyboards. It uses a table view to display the tasks, and uses UserDefaults to store the tasks.
There are 3 ViewControllers, one for viewing tasks, one for editing tasks, and one for adding tasks. The tasks are also sortable by date and
category.
